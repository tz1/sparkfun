Uses only one 512 byte buffer for all sector operations, minimal extra
generally endian agnostic (I think I got all cases, need to test).
34 state bytes total, a few more for date and such
no configuration #ifdefs (I may add some)
SD and SDHC support.  Probably MMC but you might need to slow down the SPI during initial startup
handles extended partitions. (option)
Library so only adds required code.
Creation date and time can be set (2 sec resolution), and will increment
  by 2 seconds for each new file so at least they will be sortable by date to some extent.

FAT32 ONLY (no fat16 or fat12)
One file, but limited read/mod/write and seek
does not remove directories, but can delete and truncate files
(not fully tested) will delete long filename entries for file (option)
Only handles DOS 8.3 short filenames
Limited error checking (if a call fails, don't call the successor)

SD/HC/XC supports write protect and passwords.
mount will return 1 for a locked card.
